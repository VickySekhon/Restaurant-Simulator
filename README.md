## Project Description
This restaurant simulator allows a user to create a custom menu and interact with it using an intuitive GUI from which they can print out a physical receipt. To implement this GUI, the project leverages Java's abstract classes and inheritance functionality to create a Java Jframe, by calling independent classes to create functionality as well as a PrinterJob API to invoke the Windows OS printing system.

The goal of this project is to showcase my comfortability in using fundamental OOP principles such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation.
